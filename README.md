# The Future Awaits

Ethereum 2.0 is on the horizon. Majority of the scaling problems will be addressed and worked upon.
But the most important issue blockchain technology faces is User Adoption. We might increase the throughput capacity but we can't increase the interests of general population in blockchain easily.

To enhance the user adoption, gamification is very helpful. It has the users invested both financially and emotionally. The existing games are good but also complex. Which makes the decision to invest in them difficult.
One might leave ethereum after a couple transactions but one may not leave it if they have good in-game items(NFTs) which can be sold for real money!

## The Game Plot

MarsMello is a truly decentralised Web3 game whose plot is based on colonising and industrialising Mars!
MarsMello is an **Idle-Open World-Strategy-Economy-Simulation Game!**

* Players can buy plots of land (NFTs) in the game and setup factories (NFTs) and large industries on it.
* Factories will produce **ERC20** resources which the players can claim, trade and earn from!
* Players must adopt strategies to maximise the profits as the Ore distribution and Factory efficiency will be randomised
(Because Life is Unfair)
* An In-Game Marketplace will enable users to trade and profit from the NFTs.
Given all the features and an open economy, it will be very lucrative to get hands on the game and start earning! 
This would bring in the attention to blockchain in the most simplest gamified form possible.

Wallet like Portis is used to enable smooth onboarding!
Polygon Chain is used to enable a fast transaction speed and lower transaction costs !
